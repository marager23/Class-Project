<h4>About Capitol Technology University:</h4>
<p class="intro"><img class="logo" src="Capitol Logo.png" alt="Capitol Logo">The mission of Capitol Technology University is to educate individuals for professional opportunities in engineering, computer and information sciences, and business. To provide relevant learning experiences that lead to success in the evolving global community. The 52-acre campus, located in Laurel, Maryland, is centered in one of America’s most vibrant technology corridors between Baltimore, MD and Washington, DC. This suburban campus consists of sleek, modern buildings—the academic halls are connected by glass-enclosed pedestrian walkways—plus students enjoy free parking. Instead of dorms, Capitol offer students fully furnished apartments within Innovator's Hall. Apartment styles vary, but each apartment is single sex and offers a combined living, dining, and kitchen area. Each apartment has at least one bathroom with no more than four students to one bath. When it’s time for research, students can access all the materials in The John G. and Beverly A. Puente Library which specializes in materials that support the technical and general studies curriculum of the University, plus they can use the Maryland Digital Library and other research databases. </p>
